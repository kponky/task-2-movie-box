# HNG-Internship-TASK 2
## Movie- Box Application

**Objective:**

- Create a movie discovery web application that allows users to search for movies, view details about them, and save their favorite movies. Youâ€™ll be consuming data from the TMDB API.

**Requirements**
1. ### User Interface: 
- Create a responsive and visually appealing user interface for the application. - Here's the link to the design you're expected to replicate: https://www.figma.com/file/tVfgoNfhYkQaUkh8LGqRab/MovieBox-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1220-324&mode=design&t=6998DWtjQrxz8mOf-0 
- List the top 10 movies on the homepage. 
- They should be displayed in a grid layout with their movie posters. The Card component should display the movie title and release date. card - [data-testid: movie-card] movie poster - [data-testid: movie-poster] movie title - [data-testid: movie-title] movie release date - [data-testid: movie-release-date] 

### 2. Movie Search:

- Implement a search feature that allows users to search for movies by title. 
- Display search results, including movie posters, titles, and release dates. 
- Show a loading indicator while fetching search results. 

### 3. Movie Details:
   When I go to to /movies/:id route (where :id is the imdb_id), I should see the movie details page. I should see title - [data-testid: movie-title] release date (in UTC) - [data-testid: movie-release-date] runtime (in minutes) - [data-testid: movie-runtime] overview - [data-testid: movie-overview] 

### API Integration:
- Consume the TMDB API to fetch movie data. 
- Use the following API endpoints:
- Fetch movie details by ID: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id} 

### Error Handling:

Implement error handling to display meaningful error messages to users in case of API failures or other issues.
